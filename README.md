# Self-Driving-Vehicle-Control

This respository explains the approach implemented for the final project of the course, Introduction to Self-Driving Cars from the Self-Driving Cars Coursera Specialization.

The aim of this project was to implement a controller in Python to drive a car around a track in the Carla Simulator. To control successfully the vehicle, both longitudinal and lateral controllers were implemented, in order to obtain the throttle, brake and steering control signals.
